# GreaterGood ClickToGive Autoclicker
This is an auto-clicker script for the [*GreaterGood* *ClickToGive* program](https://greatergood.com/clicktogive/ars/home).
It automatically clicks through all the buttons on all subsites of the *GreaterGood* family.

It starts on any of the subsites and works through the complete list, starting at the top left to the bottom right, leaving out the external links besides the main *GreaterGood* sites.

It uses the *click*-action on the button with a random delay after page loads, so they're correctly counted as clicked, and also works in the background.

Don't forget to **disable your ad blocker** for the site, so ads can get loaded and as such revenue be made.
