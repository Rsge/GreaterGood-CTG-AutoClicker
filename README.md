# GreaterGood ClickToGive Autoclicker
This is an auto-clicker script for the [*GreaterGood* *ClickToGive* program](https://greatergood.com/clicktogive/ars/home).
It automatically clicks through all the buttons on all subsites of the *GreaterGood* family.

It starts on any of the subsites and works through the complete list, starting at the top left to the bottom right, leaving out the two changing external links besides the main *GreaterGood* site link.

It uses the *click*-action on the buttons, so they're correctly counted as clicked and also works in the background.
